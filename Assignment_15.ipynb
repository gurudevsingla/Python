    "#### Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "#### Ans 1.\n",
    "#### Database :-\n",
    "Database is a collection of organized data that can be stored and retrieved using different database modelling and design approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Example :- Let us consider Google Chrome's Search Engine as \"Database\" because it stores the search keywords that are frequently used by the users all over the world.\n",
    "#### SQL Database :- \n",
    "* SQL database is a RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS).\n",
    "* SQL databases have fixed or static or predefined schema.\n",
    "* SQL databases display data in form of tables so it is known as table-based database.\n",
    "* SQL databases are vertically scalable.\n",
    "* SQL databases use a powerful language \"Structured Query Language\" to define and manipulate the data.\n",
    "* SQL databases are best suited for complex queries.\n",
    "* SQL databases are not best suited for hierarchical data storage.\n",
    "* MySQL, Oracle, Sqlite, PostgreSQL and MS-SQL etc. are the example of SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NoSQL Database :-\n",
    "* NoSQL database is a Non-relational or distributed database system.\n",
    "* NoSQL databases have dynamic schema.\n",
    "* NoSQL databases display data as collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores.\n",
    "* NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.\n",
    "* In NoSQL databases, collection of documents are used to query the data. It is also called unstructured query language. It varies from database to database.\n",
    "* NoSQL databases are not so good for complex queries because these are not as powerful as SQL queries.\n",
    "* NoSQL databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage.\n",
    "* MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDB, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j, CouchDB etc. are the example of nosql database."

    "* SYNTAX for Adding New Column in Existing Table: ALTER TABLE tablename ADD new_Columnname datatype; Ex: ALTER TABLE payment_methods ADD Transaction_Date Date;\n",
    "\n",
